### Week in Review
Good first week, I stayed mostly on track and definitely felt that I got a few more things done (especially watching the Elixir videos) than I would have without starting this Personal Goals project. I wonder if there's any way to setup IFTTT to work with Pocket so that I can automatically get media I'm saving over to this repo in some fashion. Something to look into. All in all - great start!
