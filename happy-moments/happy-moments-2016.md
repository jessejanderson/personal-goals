Calvin **demanded** we watch Star Wars today (We watched the first hour). He's really starting to remember all the names even though he's only seen it once now - stormtroopers, R2-D2, Darth Vader, Luke, Chewbacca, etc. Still struggling to say C-3PO though. "three seee... wut his name?" Pretty fun watching him grow to love something I love. ;)

Watched the Broncos destroy the Panthers in Super Bowl 50 with a bunch of PCO friends in the office - had a great time!
