Calvin **demanded** we watch Star Wars today (We watched the first hour). He's really starting to remember all the names even though he's only seen it once now - stormtroopers, R2-D2, Darth Vader, Luke, Chewbacca, etc. Still struggling to say C-3PO though. "three seee... wut his name?" Pretty fun watching him grow to love something I love. ;)

Cripes! Missed a day - well it was the first day of a remote week, so I'm sure many good times were had.

Company hang out at Bagby in Oceanside. Had a good time hanging out with my PCO peeps, drinking White Russians, and enjoying the Cookie/Ice Cream sampler.
