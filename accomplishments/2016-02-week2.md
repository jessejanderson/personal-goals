### Week in Review
A little off-track as for keeping up with this, due to the Design Division Summit in Utah. Despite the thin completion list above, feel like I accomplished a lot this week. So far using the Anki system for trying to retain what I learn has been working great, really feels like it's making a different and I've got a pretty solid grasp on 2/3 of the Enum functions. Most of my hangups seems to be with things that are similar, just slightly different (at vs fetch, group_by, vs partition, etc).
