Not going to try to force doing this daily since I keep forgetting, but I'm going to keep it around for times I do want to record a happy moment. Maybe over time I will be able to build up the habit, but right now I'm not going to force it.

Calvin **demanded** we watch Star Wars today (We watched the first hour). He's really starting to remember all the names even though he's only seen it once now - stormtroopers, R2-D2, Darth Vader, Luke, Chewbacca, etc. Still struggling to say C-3PO though. "three seee... wut his name?" Pretty fun watching him grow to love something I love. ;)

Watched the Broncos destroy the Panthers in Super Bowl 50 with a bunch of PCO friends in the office - had a great time!

Cripes! Missed a day - well it was the first day of a remote week, so I'm sure many good times were had.

Company hang out at Bagby in Oceanside. Had a good time hanging out with my PCO peeps, drinking White Russians, and enjoying the Cookie/Ice Cream sampler.

Played some Jungle Pong with a new Alley-oop rule which makes it absolutely insane!

Family is sick so not a whole lot of fun happening in the house right now. Watched Sherlock (S3 E2) with the wife which was quite strange but very entertaining.

Surprised the wife with some delivered flowers and had a great day, despite all the sickness in the house.
